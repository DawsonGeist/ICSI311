# ICSI311
Contains two projects from my ICSI 311 - Principles of Programming Languages - Class at the University at Albany; Included is a Simplified BASIC language interpreter, and a Script written in SCHEME that navigated formatted lists and added values stored within them. Simulated a simple File System, and the values that were added were File Sizes.
